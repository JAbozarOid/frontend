      The --save-dev flag in npm saves those dependencies as dev dependencies,
      which means that they will only be installed for development. They will
      not be installed and included in a deployed app. This is important in
      order to keep the size of our containers as small as possible later.

      The npx command allows us to execute commands provided by npm packages, in
      a similar context as running them in package.json scripts would do. It can
      also run remote packages without installing them permanently. If the
      package is not installed yet, it will ask you whether it should do this.

      Now, run npm run lint in the Terminal. This should execute eslint src
      successfully,just like npx eslint src did:
