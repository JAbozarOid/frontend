        In general, there are two ways to export modules in JavaScript:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Using default exports : default exports, you can export as many items from any JavaScript file as you want </li>
        <li>Using named exports : Named exports are a way to export only certain parts of a given JavaScript file.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <b>export default</b> function addTwo(a, b) {
        console.log(a + b);
        }
    </p>
    <p>
        function addTwo(a, b) {
        console.log(a + b);
        }
    </p>
    <p>
        function addThree(a, b, c) {
        console.log(a + b + c);
        }
    </p>
    <p>export { addTwo, addThree }; <b>Using named exports</b> </p>

    <p><b>import module</b> import addTwo from "./addTwo"; <b>which was exported by export default</b></p>
    <p><b>import module</b> import { addTwo } from "./addTwo"; <b>which was exported by named exports</b></p>

    <script src="index.js">
      // we can reference to javascript file index.js with "src"
    </script>
