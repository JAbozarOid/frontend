        <p><b>React Hooks : </b> Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class, enabling functional components to manage state and side effects.</p>
        <p><b>JSX : </b> JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to create React elements.</p>

        <p><b>map() operator : </b> transform data / method is useful for handling third party data /  method is a transformation operation /  method returns a new array</p>
        <p><b>key identifier : </b>
            Keys are identifier's that help React to determine which items have changed or added or are removed.
            Keys instruct React how to treat a specific element when an update occurs.
            Keys instruct React about whether a specific element’s internal state should be preserved or not.
            Although item indexes can be used as keys,
            using indexes as keys can create problems if the order of your list of items is prone to change and can negatively affect performance.
            Using unique and stable identifiers, such as item IDs, is recommended instead.

                Controlled components :
            </b>
            are a set of components that offer a declarative application programming interface or API
            to enable full control of the state of form elements at any point in time using React state.
            Rather than relying on the native state from DOM elements,
            the React state is made the single source of truth, controlling the displayed value of your form elements at all times.
            The way you perform this state delegation is via the value prop.
            Value is a special property, the React added to most of the form elements to determine the input content at any point in time during the render life cycle.
            In order to create a controlled component, you need to use a combination of local state and the value prop
        </p>

            <b>
                Controlled Inputs:
            </b>
            Controlled inputs are form elements whose value is managed by React state, allowing for immediate updates and validation.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>
                Uncontrolled Inputs:
            </b>
            Uncontrolled inputs are standard HTML form elements that maintain their own state, accessed via React refs.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>
                React Refs:
            </b>
            Refs provide a way to access DOM nodes directly, allowing for value retrieval from uncontrolled inputs.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>
                Form Validation:
            </b>
            Controlled inputs allow for instant validation and conditional rendering based on input values.
        </p>
        <p><b>
            difference between controlled and uncontrolled components :
        </b>
            Recall the controlled components in React are those in which form data is handled by the component's state. Whereas uncontrolled components are those in which the form data is handled by the DOM itself.
