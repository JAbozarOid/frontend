    <p>React uses the virtual DOM to update the browser Dom only when needed.</p>
    <p>This ensures that the update is as minimal as possible, increasing the application speed and performance. </p>
    <p>html tags inside of React component Function are not really HTML, they are JSX </p>
    <p><b>JSX</b> allows to write javascript code inside html tags (JSX is combined HTML and JavaScript) </p>
    <p>All Components in React Must be Capitalized name : Button.jsx (it lead to different html files with React
        Compomnent files) </p>
    <p><b>Transpiling</b> : as a process of converting JSX to HTML ( A browser cannot understand JSX syntax.)</p>
    <p>old browser to understand the ES6 code, the only way to do it is by transpiling it.</p>
    <p>create React app Project : npm init react-app . ("." means inside of this folder) </p>
    <p><b>Babel</b> : is a JavaScript Compiler</p>
    <p><b>Babel</b> : it allows you to transpile JSX code (which cannot be understood by a browser) into plain
        JavaScript code (which can be understood by a browser)</p>
    <p><b>Props :</b> properties in React component functions, like passing parameters to a javascript function</p>
    <p><b>Props :</b> passing data between components</p>
    <p><b>Props :</b> the component send props is parent and the component receive props is child</p>
    <p><b>Props : traspile JSX --> </b> function App() {
          return React.createElement(
            "div",
            {},
        React.createElement("h1", {}, "Hello there") // {} --> is props
          );
        }</p>
    <p><b>JavaScript Object :</b> an object is a special type of variable that can contain many values</p>
    <p><b>JavaScript Object :</b> use objects when you need to store groups of related data of different types. Each data type is known as an object property</p>
    <p><b>JSX : "h1 className="-----" and HTML : "h1 class="----"</b></p>
    <p><b>JSX : "onClick" and HTML : "onclick"</b></p>
    <p><b>Hooks : </b> Hooks are functions that were introduced in React version 16.8. They let you hook into React state and lifestyle features from components</p>
    <p><b>Hooks : useState()</b>This hook is used to manage the state within a component and keep track of it and it's built directly into React.</p>
    <p><b>Hooks : useState()</b>It creates a state variable with an initial value </p>
    <p><b>Hooks : </b>You can only call hooks at the top level of your component or your own hooks. </p>
    <p><b>Hooks : </b>You cannot call hooks inside loops or conditions. </p>
    <p><b>Hooks : </b>You can only call hooks from React functions, and not regular JavaScript functions. </p>
    <p><b>Hooks : </b>useContext, useMemo, useRef</p>
    <p><b>Hooks : Custom Hooks </b>When you need to share logic and reuse the same logic across several components, you can extract the logic into a custom hook. </p>
    <p><b>Hooks : Custom Hooks </b>Custom hooks offer flexibility and can be used for a wide range of use-cases such as form handling, animation, timers, and many more. </p>
    <p><b>Hooks : useRef() </b>We use the useRef hook to access a child element directly.When you invoke the useRef hook, it will return a ref object. The ref object has a property named current. </p>
    <p><b>lifting up state </b> moving the state from the child component to the parent component </p>
    <p><b>negative result of lifting up state in a React app </b> prop drilling </p>
    <p><b>When lifting state up, you need to move the useState from a child component to a parent component</b> </p>
    <p><b>The process of lifting up state can lead to</b> a stateless component becoming a stateful component</p>
    <p><b>Context Api</b> avoid having to pass state down through multiple levels of components</p>
    <p><b>Navigation in React</b>
        In a traditional website, when the button is clicked, the browser will send a POST request to the web server. The web server will return a new web page containing the button and movie name, and the web browser renders the new page.

        In a Single Page Application, when the button is clicked, the browser will send a POST request to a web server. The web server will return a JSON object. The application reads the object and updates the Label with the movie name.
    </p>
    <p><b>
        key concepts in React Navigation
    </b><br/>
        * Bundling: The process of loading all necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript resources at once when the application is first requested.<br/>
        * Navigation: The method by which users move between different views or components in an application, which differs significantly between SPAs and traditional web apps.<br/>
        * Lazy Loading: A technique where only the minimum resources needed to load the application are fetched initially, with additional resources loaded as required.<br/>
        * Single Page Application (SPA): A web application that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page rather than loading entire new pages from the server.<br/>
    </p>

    <p><b>React Router</b> : npm install react-router-dom</p>
    <p><b>Bundling </b>  is a process that takes all the imported files in an app and joins them into a single file, referred to as a bundle.</p>
    <p><b>Bundling tools</b>several tools can perform this bundling --> webpack</p>
